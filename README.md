# JS-stroll

This repo is comprised of tiny JavaScript and SVG excercises for generative effects. Most code exercises in this repo are from [*The Nature of Code*](http://natureofcode.com/), originally written in [Processing](https://processing.org/); the code is rewritten in JavaScript to solidify the underlying concepts.

Other code exercises in this repo are from Rachel Smith's *Hack Physics with JavaScript* series of posts ([Part 1](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/post/hack-physics-and-javascript-1), [Part 2](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/post/hack-physics-and-javascript-part-2-solving-triangles-profit), & [Part 3](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/post/hack-physics-and-javascript-part-3-springs-and-some-other-things)); the code is rewritten in SVG and JavaScript instead of leveraging Canvas and JavaScript.

Commented at the top of the main.js file of every directory is the URL to the original code exercises as well as a codepen demo of the output.
