# JS-stroll

This repo is comprised of tiny JavaScript and SVG excercises for generative effects. 

Some of these demos are rewriting code from 'The Nature of Code', originally written in Processing, in JavaScript to solidify the unerlying concepts. Some are rewriting Rachel Smith's Hack Physics with JavaScript posts in SVG and vanilla JS (originals are in Canvas). Some are just taking physics equations and using them to write demos with SVG.

If it was rewritten from another source, commented at the top of the main.js file of every directory is the url to the original code, where applicable. 

If I used ES6, the babel file will have the original source code, and the linked js will have the compiled JavaScript.

All files have a link to a CodePen demo of the output.
